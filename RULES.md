# AnimeWallpapersSFW Rules

## 1. No Excessive NSFW

You're allowed to post things that are slightly NSFW, but nothing that can be considered sexual in nature.

Basically, posts that include [changing clothes](https://i.imgur.com/TOJSWC2.png), [sexually suggestive posing/emphasis](https://i.imgur.com/9l0tYMS.jpg), or [nearly naked](https://i.imgur.com/R5LtFAA.png) are not okay, but something that [shows skin](https://i.imgur.com/zm7LLfO.jpg) or has a [character with large breasts](https://i.imgur.com/6BuvsyS.png) is okay.

## 2. You Must Provide a Link to the OC

Use [SauceNAO](https://saucenao.com/), [Google](https://www.google.com/imghp?hl=en), or [IDQB](http://iqdb.org/) to find the source.

The source should clearly show an author's name on a web page. For example, [this pixiv post](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/68126524) by 杉８７.

Please comment the source in a timely manner from posting.

If directly from a manga/anime/ln, we also have u/Roboragi, so please use it.

## 3. Format Title Accordingly

Please use the format: 

`Name [Source/Original] (Resolution)`

For example: 

`Ochako is Happy [My Hero Academia] (2250x4000)`

## 4. Flair Posts Correctly

Use the "Desktop" and "Mobile" flairs accordingly on your posts.

This is important for people to be able to sort and find your wallpapers!

## 5. Minimum Resolution and Aspect Ratio

Minimum desktop resolution is ‭1920x1080 (16:9). 

Minimum mobile resolution is 900x1600 (9:16 | 0.5625).

Desktop aspect ratios to be at or wider than 16:10.

Mobile aspect ratios to be within 0.40 to 0.65 (width/height=ratio) (based on [popular resolutions](https://deviceatlas.com/blog/most-used-smartphone-screen-resolutions)).

If a post has sufficient whitespace, exceptions will be made.

Use [Waifu2x](https://waifu2x.booru.pics/) if necessary.

## 6. No Requests

This sub is currently not for requests. If you have a request to edit a photo, you can consult r/PhotoshopRequest.

If we get enough feedback for it, we can look into having a request thread.
